#Web Developer Technical Exercise 

**Description:**

You are asked to develop a web application to track issues using C# and MVC 5 (preferred). The
application may use Microsoft ASP Identity 2.0 for login; however, it is not required.

The application may use classic MVC 5 with razor views or using MVC Web APIs as a Single Page App
(SPA) with any popular framework, such as AngularJS, ReactJS, Knockout, JQuery, etc.

Provided is Issue Data Model, a self-contained Visual Studio 2013 project. The project requires
