    <h3>Web Developer Technical Exercise</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>
        You are asked to develop a web application to track issues using C# and MVC 5 (preferred).
        The application may use Microsoft ASP Identity 2.0 for login; however, it is not required.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application may use classic MVC 5 with razor views or using MVC Web APIs as a Single
        Page App (SPA) with any popular framework, such as AngularJS, ReactJS, Knockout, JQuery,
        etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Provided is Issue Data Model, a self-contained Visual Studio 2013 project. The project
        requires SSDT. You can run the project F5 and use the builtin (localdb) database or deploy
        the project to SQL Server Express for development.
